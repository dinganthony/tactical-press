> "The ball is round, the game lasts 90 minutes, everything else is pure theory." &mdash; Sepp Herberger

Hey! I'm Anthony. By day, I'm an (incoming) software development engineer at Amazon. By night, I'm a fan of both data analysis and the beautiful game.

Tactical Press is my latest passion project, where I hope to wrangle with publicly available data to draw some conclusions about teams, players, and tactics revolving around Europe's top leagues. 

*The opinions in these analyses are mine only, and do not reflect the opinions of any professional organization or company.*

### Ted Lasso

Like Coach Lasso, I'm an American, and much of my readerbase will probably be as well. To avoid ambiguity, I will use "soccer" instead of "football" throughout. Personally, I would prefer to call it "football", but then many of my friends would then question why my blog gives so much emphasis on kickers and punters. 

### In Terms of Money, We Have No Money

Soccer as a sport is rapidly evolving into the modern age, and with it so is the science and statistics that powers decision making at the elite level. Teams increasingly rely on data-driven conclusions to adjust their strategies. However, most of this data is paywalled by companies that collect, process, and generate them. These companies primariliy operate B2B and the price levels for their data packages reflect this. As an non-affiliated analyst, I can only really rely on free, publicly available data, or try to create or label my own data from (re)watching games.

### Looking Beyond xG
A lot of statistical analysis in today's game uses xG as a primary indicator of a team's performance or the validity of a manager's strategy. While xG does have its uses, I would like to look at other stats, models, and visualizations.
