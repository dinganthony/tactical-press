Hey! I'm Anthony. By day, I'm an undergrad student at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu), majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. By night, I'm a casual writer and blogger, data analytics hobbyist, and copious consumer of all things soccer. 

I'd love to pretend that there was some coffee-fueled epiphany that led me to suddenly start this project, but it's really been in the works for a while, as a three-way marriage of my aforementioned three passions. Today, I finally decided to tie the knot.

So what's this all about anyway? Let's start with the name:

<div class="message">
Tactical (<i>adj.</i>)<br/>
In soccer, describing the strategies, instructions, and mindsets of teams to enhance their collective gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
Press (<i>n.</i>)
<br/>
1. News, media.
<br/>
2. In soccer, an act of pressure on an opponent to attempt to win the ball or force bad plays.
</div>

In the modern game, tactics are essential, nuanced, and can be the deciding factor in wins or losses. ***Tactical Press* explores these tactics, with an emphasis on data analytics and visualization**. 

A look into my methodology: I'll be analyzing public data from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com), [Github](https://github.com), and [these sources](https://linkedin.com/pulse/soccer-analytics-data-beginners-guide-christian-kotitschke/). Unfortunately, most of the detailed stats are primarily B2B, so I may try my hand at training my own computer vision models on image or video data.

This domain is exciting in part because there's no "correct" tactic. There are metas, and counter-metas, and setups that work only because N'Golo KantÃ© has six lungs, and *oh my god I'm against Messi, let me man-mark him with five players and oops he still scored*. The beautiful game keeps evolving, as we find new ways to get a ball inside a net, within the constraints of the laws of physics ([well, debatable](https://youtu.be/vQZmRqxnH6M)) and some arbitrary rules. 

This quote by the World Cup-winning West Germany coach sums it up best:

> "The ball is round, the game lasts 90 minutes, everything else is pure theory." &mdash; Sepp Herberger
